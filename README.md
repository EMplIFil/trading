Trading for a living
--------------------

As a trader, I need to understand when to buy and when to sell. I need to understand what to buy and what to sell. I need to understand how much to buy and how much to sell.

Simple. Not easy. 

In order to answer the question of what to buy I need to identify a set of assets that 
have certain properties and characteristics that can be identified and from which information can be extracted and signals about which action can be drawn.

In order to answer the question of when to buy, I need to construct models of price behavior and then apply these models to current price behavior in order to predict whether to buy or sell a particular asset at a given time. 

The question of how much to buy is concerned with an asset allocation strategy and that is intended to address the question of diversification of risk. 


Discretionary and Systematic trading
------------------------------------

If we are in a discretionary trading environment, I suspect much of this knowledge will be internalized in my head through experience. 

In an algorithmic trading scenario, this knowledge will be mostly something captured in a routine or algorithm. 

Much of this work will focus on algorithmic trading. 


Risk and Opportunity
--------------------

Exposure to risk and opportunity are the two sides of the sword. 

How shall we think about this?

The question of what and how much are related in the sense that we want to be maximally exposed to upside behavior and minimally exposed to downside movement. So how much and to what shall we allocate our resources would be answerable if we understood the relationship certain assets have to one another. 

How to decide what to focus on?
-------------------------------

For now, out of curiosity and ignorance I will focus on cryptocurrencies.
